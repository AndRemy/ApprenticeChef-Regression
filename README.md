# Apprentice Chef - A Machine Learning Regression Model

The company Apprentice Chef offers its busy customers the possibility to receive at their door a selection of
daily-prepared meals together with a selection of disposable cookware for easy cleanup. Each meal takes 30 minutes to
finish cooking at home, and the orders can be done through a user-friendly on-line platform and mobile app

In the current project I am aiming to create a Supervised Machine Learning Regression model that will predict the
revenue a client will bring to the company.

## Files

- [utils](utils): Contains a reusable methods that are used across the entire project to do the analysis and build the
  models.
- [data/Apprentice_Chef_Dataset.xlsx](data/Apprentice_Chef_Dataset.xlsx): Excel spreadsheet that contains the data
  required to do the analysis and create de final model
- [SupervisedLearning_Analysis.ipynb](SupervisedLearning_Analysis.ipynb): Built in Jupyter Notebook, it contains the
  analysis to create the model. The visual analysis has its independent file.
- [SupervisedLearning_VisualAnalysis.ipynb](SupervisedLearning_VisualAnalysis.ipynb): Built in Jupyter Notebook, it
  contains the visual exploratory analysis necessary to create the model
- [Final_Model.py](Final_Model.py): A python script that creates the final model from the analysis made.
- [model/ApprenticeChef_RegressionModel.pkl](model/ApprenticeChef_RegressionModel.pkl): Contains a series of
  supplementary files that were used as support during the analysis.
