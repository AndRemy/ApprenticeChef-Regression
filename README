# Apprentice Chef - A Machine Learning Regression Model
The company Apprentice Chef offers its busy customers the possibility to receive at their door a selection of 
daily-prepared meals together with a selection of disposable cookware for easy cleanup. Each meal takes 30 minutes to 
finish cooking at home, and the orders can be done through a user-friendly on-line platform and mobile app

In the current project I am aiming to create a Supervised Machine Learning Regression model that will predict the 
revenue a client will bring to the company.

## Files
- [Analysis.ipynb](Analysis.ipynb): Built in Jupyter Notebook, it contains the full analysis to create the model
- [Final_Model.py](Final_Model.py): A python script that creates the final model from the analysis made.
- [data/Apprentice_Chef_Dataset.xlsx](data/Apprentice_Chef_Dataset.xlsx): Excel file that contains the data required to 
do the analysis and create de final model
- [analysis](analysis): Contains a series of supplementary files that were used as support during the analysis.
